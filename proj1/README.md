# Project 1: API Reversing
**Overview**: 
 - Students are given a Java application that connects to a web server and makes requests to it.
 - Students will need to reverse-engineer the API and bypass the limits placed on the application.

**Goals**:
 - Obtain the API key
 - Figure out all of the routes required
 - Figure out how to bypass the limits
 - Create their own proxy to access the server

**Estimated Time**: 2 hours

**Files**:
 - `app.jar`: The application that students will be reversing
   - Located in `files\app.jar`

## Setup
Students must download `app.jar`, which is the main focus of this project.

The `app.jar` can be placed anywhere on the student's computer.

To run the application, students can double-click on the file, or run `java -jar app.jar` from the command line.

## Required Applications
  - Java 8 or higher
  - An internet connection

## Suggested Applications
  - Any sort of Java decompiler (JD-GUI, IntelliJ, VSCode, etc.)
  - An IDE (VSCode, etc.)

## Submission
  - Students should submit a writeup of their findings, including:
    - The API key
    - The routes required
    - How they bypassed the limits
    - How they created their proxy
